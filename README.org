* Notes
** Home impermanence
Apparently, while it is not necessary to manually make the system impermanence directories manually on =/nix/persist=, it is *necessary* to do so for the home impermanence modules. This is likely because the home impermanence modules are run as the user, not root, and they do not have the privilege to write on =/nix/persist=.
